This competition focuses on the problem of forecasting the future values of multiple time series, as it has always been one of the most challenging problems in the field. More specifically, we aim the competition at testing state-of-the-art methods designed by the participants, on the problem of forecasting future web traffic for approximately 145,000 Wikipedia articles.

Sequential or temporal observations emerge in many key real-world problems, ranging from biological data, financial markets, weather forecasting, to audio and video processing. The field of time series encapsulates many different problems, ranging from analysis and inference to classification and forecast. What can you do to help predict future views?
